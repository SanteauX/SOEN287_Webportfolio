All your forms should be defined as subclasses of FlaskForm
--> They are

and should have properly defined validators.
--> Validtors are either part of the form or in the function creating the data send to csv, but are checked anyway

Your forms should be handled properly, by defining a route accepting GET and POST methods,
--> They do

and you should use the POST/REDIRECT/GET pattern when the form data validates (as shown in class).


Your web site data should be stored in files, located in the data subfolder. 
The data should in CSV or JSON formats.
--> accounts.csv
--> blog_posts.csv
--> github_projects.csv
--> messages.csv

Your web site should contain:

            At least 2 forms:
            with at least one of these forms which must be significantly different 
            from the ones included in the examples covered in class and in the tutorials.
            --> Signup          1
            --> Login           2
            --> ContactForm     3
            --> Post (blog)     4

            At least 1 table and at least 1 list created dynamically from data stored in a local file
            or a local SQLite DB (or some other DB). These pages can be, or not, directly connected to your forms.
            --> myMessages          1
            --> projects (github)   2


            A way to support user logins:
            --> it does

            Some pages should be protected and viewable by only the logged in users.
            --> messages
            --> account
            --> statistics

            There should be a way, in each page, to figure out if a user is logged in or not.
            xxxxxxxxxxxxx

            You could have a special div in your base template that displays whether a user is logged in or not.
            --> Login

            JavaScript input or form validation, using regular expressions where appropriate, on at least 2 forms.
